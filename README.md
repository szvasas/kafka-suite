# Welcome to KafkaSuite!

KafkaSuite is a Java/Kotlin library which allows you to start a Kafka cluster in Docker containers and test your application against it. Since each node of the cluster runs in a separate container it is ideal for fault-injection testing.

* [kafka-suite](/kafka-suite) module contains the source code of the library and more information about the supported features.
* [kafka-suite-demo](/kafka-suite-demo) is a collection of end-to-end fault-injection testing scenarios.
