# Welcome to KafkaSuite!

KafkaSuite is a Java/Kotlin library that allows you to launch a Kafka cluster in Docker containers and test your application against it. Since each node of the cluster runs in its own container, it's ideal for fault-injection testing.

* [kafka-suite](/kafka-suite) module contains the source code of the library and further information about the supported features.
* [kafka-suite-demo](/kafka-suite-demo) is a collection of end-to-end fault-injection testing scenarios.
